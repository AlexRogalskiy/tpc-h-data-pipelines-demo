# Data Pipeline Framework Demo

The following documentation provides demonstration of a complete dbt project created using data processing framework, namely [data-pipelines-cli](https://data-pipelines-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) created and developed by DataOps Labs Team. The project aims to transform busines oriented SQL queries, introduced in the TPC Benchmark H (TPC-H) into functional dbt models. The benchmark is designed for performance evaluation of decision supporting systems. For this project, however, it serves either as a source of synthetic database, simulating data from a real-life-like industry, and provides the catalogue of 22 *ad hoc* business oriented queries. These queries are designed to provide valuable insights on the (hypotethic) industry. For selected models, the external BI tool (Google Data Studio) has been chosen to demontrate possible outcome of the legacy SQL dbt adaptation process.
