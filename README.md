# TCP-H Data Pipelines Project

## Description

This is an example of a [Data Pipelines](https://data-pipelines-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) project that has data pipelines simulating operations of a fictional company.
The purpose is to show you how an advanced [Data Pipelines](https://data-pipelines-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) project can look like. This project can be used as an example
when you work on your [Data Pipelines](https://data-pipelines-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) project.
You can see the contents of the repository and see how ```models```, ```tests``` and ```seeds``` look like, so that the process of implementation
in your project is easier.

## Data used in this project example

We used data from [TCP-H](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/), which is a set of data sets that are used for benchmarking of
decision support systems. This project simulates data and processes of a fictional company. We placed the data in a
[GCP BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) dataset.
